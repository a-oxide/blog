## Introduction
This project began when I received a Raspberry Pi 4b as a gift from my lovely girlfriend. I had long sought a similarly capable single-board computer to host a [Safing Community Node](https://safing.io/spn/). After realizing the (many) risks of hosting a public node from my dorm internet, I began researching other uses. After stumbling upon the [Raspberry Pi Recovery Kit](https://www.doscher.com/work-recovery-kit/) by Jay Doscher, I had an idea to adapt his design into a mobile Software Defined Radio (SDR)/digital storage device.

##Disclaimer
I know that this is far from the most efficient configuration for a RPi-based SDR. I chose this specific route not simply based on efficacy but rather as a way to explore other engineering challenges besides RF.
